A brief, but hopefully current, list of the features I want to add or fix.

Use-cases still to cover
=========================

These items might not be problems yet. Need to check they're possible and fill
in support.

- non-ASCII tags and sorting order. We're obviously going to fail a strict
  version of the Turkish test, but the main pieces should Just Work. I want to
  remember to verify that.

Problems
=========
- In normal code, we have to handle the case of attempting to create and save a
  node that already exists.

- Think about any API requirements for supporting multiple databases (since I
  have a few methods that create objects).

Tasks
======
- Javascript tree widget for editing
    - YUI-based
    - dynamic loading of data for really large sets.

- Add a setup.py and possibly other build scripts that the Kool Kids use these
  days.

- Main documentation updates (update to match current use of mptt from
  treebeard).

- Use a less fugly documentation theme (requires spinx >= 0.6).
    - maybe haiku or scrolls.

- Multiple things need to be done in the tree view (on the changei-list page).
  Not quite sure how to shoe-horn all these together yet:
    - Expand a node (on-demand loading)
    - Add a new root node
    - Add a new child node (add new root and then move? Seems okay except
      in mobile side)
    - Edit details of node (going to the edit page for a particular node)
    - Move node or entire subtree (drag-and-drop, hopefully. But how does
      it work with really large trees?)
    - Mobile device UX
