A brief, but hopefully current, list of the features I want to add or fix.

Use-cases still to cover
=========================

These items might not be problems yet. Need to check they're possible and fill in support.

- non-ASCII tags and sorting order. We're obviously going to fail a strict
  version of the Turkish test, but the main pieces should Just Work. I want to
  remember to verify that.

- merging nodes is going to need a way to trigger "old URL storage" for HTTP
  redirects. (Maybe) not by default, but certainly as an option. Will be an
  issue on my blog, for example.

Problems
=========
- The bulk delete action in Django 1.1 should also delete children of any node
  selected for delete (and include them in the confirmation list before doing
  so).

- In normal code, we have to handle the case of attempting to create and save a
  node that already exists.

- When moving nodes, both in code and in the admin, need to handle merging
  trees. For example, if the tree looks like this:

        software/languages/python
        software/languages/python/debugging
        software/python/
        software/python/debugging
        software/python/design-patterns

  and we move software/python to underneath software/languages, the new nodes
  that have names similar to existing nodes should merge and the new tree
  should look like:

        software/languages/python/
        software/languages/python/debugging
        software/languages/python/design-patterns

  The tricky part here is that this means some pk values will change, so
  references to those objects have to be updated.

Features
=========
- Javascript tree widget for editing
        - YUI-based
        - JQuery-based
        - dynamic loading of data for really large sets.

- Add a setup.py and possibly other build scripts that the Kool Kids use these
  days.
