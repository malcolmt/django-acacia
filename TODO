A brief, but hopefully current, list of the features I want to add or fix.

Problems
==========
- The bulk delete action in Django 1.1 should also delete children of any node
  selected for delete (and include them in the confirmation list before doing
  so).

Features
=========
- Javascript tree widget for editing
	- YUI-based
	- JQuery-based
	- dynamic loading of data for really large sets.
