Documentation For Acacia
========================

Acacia is a small Django application that provides hierarchical topic or
category objects. Other Django applications can then use the topic trees to
categorise objects using human-readable names. The primary use of this
application is to provide a tree structure with a way to retrieve nodes in the
hierarchy using the human-readable name of the node.
